# FIRE DETECTION USING IMAGE PROCESSING

## Overview

The "Fire Detection using Image Processing" project is an advanced web application developed in Django that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on imagenet to detect fire incidents in real-time video feeds. The primary objective of this project is to provide an efficient and timely fire detection system to mitigate potential fire hazards.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Fire Detection:** The application processes live video feeds and swiftly detects fire incidents, ensuring timely responses to potential fire hazards.

- **Alarm and Notifications:** Upon detecting fire, the system triggers an automated alarm to prompt immediate attention. Additionally, it sends notifications to the user's specified contact number, ensuring quick and decisive action.

- **Support for Multiple Devices:** The application supports various devices using IPWebcam, allowing users to integrate additional cameras for comprehensive fire surveillance.

## Tech Stack

The project leverages cutting-edge technologies and tools to deliver robust fire detection capabilities:

- Python: The core programming language used for application development.
- Django: A powerful web framework that provides a robust foundation for building scalable web applications.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Employed for image processing and detecting fire patterns in video frames.
- Image Processing: Utilized to analyze video frames and identify fire-related patterns or characteristics.
- IPWebcam: Enables integration with multiple devices, expanding the scope of surveillance.
- HTML and CSS: Used for designing an intuitive and user-friendly web interface.

## Installation and Setup

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/TanayZope/final-Year-Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd final-Year-Project`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
5. Access the application in your web browser at: `http://localhost:8000/`

## Usage

1. Provide necessary permissions for camera access when prompted.
2. Start the live video feed to initiate fire detection.
3. In the event of fire detection, the system triggers an alarm and sends notifications to the provided contact number.
