**Project: FIRE DETECTION USING IMAGE PROCESSING**

![Project Banner](https://link.to/your/project/banner/image)

### Overview

The "Fire Detection using Image Processing" project is a web application developed in Django that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on imagenet to detect the presence or absence of fire in real-time video feeds. The application accepts live feed video input from the device camera and processes the frames to detect potential fire incidents. Upon fire detection, the system raises an alarm and promptly sends notifications to the user's provided contact number.

### Key Features

- Real-time Fire Detection: The application processes live video feeds and detects fire incidents in real-time, providing timely responses to potential fire hazards.

- Alarm and Notifications: In the event of fire detection, an automated alarm is triggered, ensuring immediate attention. Additionally, notifications are sent to the user's specified contact number for prompt action.

- Support for Multiple Devices: The application supports various devices using IPWebcam, allowing users to integrate additional cameras for comprehensive coverage.

### Tech Stack

The project leverages the following technologies and tools:

- Python
- Django
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Image Processing
- IPWebcam
- HTML, CSS

### Installation and Setup

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/TanayZope/final-Year-Project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd final-Year-Project`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`
5. Access the application in your web browser at: `http://localhost:8000/`

### Usage

1. Provide the necessary permissions for camera access when prompted.
2. Start the live video feed to begin fire detection.
3. In case of fire detection, the system will trigger an alarm and send notifications to the provided contact number.
