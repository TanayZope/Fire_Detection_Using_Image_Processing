Fire Detection using Image Processing

In our Final Year Project, we created a web application in Django that takes live feed video input from the device camera (One can even add other devices using IPWebcam ) and feeds the input in the form of image frames to a CNN imagenet-based DL model that detects the presence or absence of fire.
On detection of fire, it raises an alarm and sends a notification to the number the user had provided before starting the live feed
